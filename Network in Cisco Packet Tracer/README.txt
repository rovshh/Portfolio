Network in Cisco Packet Tracer

Individual University project for IT Platforms course. In this project I created a network in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Network included routers, DHCP server, DNS server, Web server, Firewall, DMZ, desktops, wireless access points, 
laptops, mobile phones. All routers were interconnected, Network had IP Classes A, B and C. DHCP server was 
assigning IP addresses to all devices in network and considered if device is in Class A, B or C network.
Main objective: learn and understand networks, IP Classes, get practical experience in building such systems in 
simulator.
