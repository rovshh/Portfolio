Shipping Company

Individual University project for Backend programming course. In this project I developed a programm in Java. 
In this programm user defined the quantity of pre-defined objects (TVs, Laptops, Mouses and Desktops) with their 
own dimentions and weights. Then programm calculated the shipping cost and the amount of big or small containers 
(with own dimentions and weight restrictions) used for this shipment.
Main objective: learn and implement OOP with Java, make a GUI in Eclipse IDE.
