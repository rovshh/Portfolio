Team University project for Big Data & Analytics course. In this project we designed and created a database for an imaginary gym. First and main step was to 
design structure of database, optimize it to 3NF (Third Normal Form) and make the Entity-Relation diagrams. After 
that we created database in MySQL and added many data entries. Finally we practiced making request and sorting in 
database.
Main objective: learn database structure, design system, implement normalization correctly, code a database, make 
requests.
