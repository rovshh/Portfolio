Concept for Car Dealership Application

Team University project for Startup Management course. In this project my team and I  had to implement our 
knowledge of Software Development Life Cycle and create a concept for a Car Dealership application. We conducted 
Feasibility study and Requirements Analysis to understand our audience and requirements of a client. Then in 
Requirements Definition we created Workflow and Dataflow diagrams and defined functional and non-functuinal 
requirements. Also we specified all measurement which needed to be monitored. Finally, we made a list of 
implementations for a knowledge gain from measurements.
Main objective: learn and implement Software Development Life Cycle, define measurements, learn from the results 
of measurements.
