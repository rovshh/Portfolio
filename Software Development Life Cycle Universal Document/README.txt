Software Development Life Cycle Universal Document

Individual University project for Software Engineering course. In this project, I created a document, which is 
universal instruction (plan) of SDLC implementation with Software Quality Assurance for any project. This work 
includes a detailed plan for each stage of Software Development Life Cycle with all necessary inputs, processing, 
outputs, measurements, including Source Code Management documents. Besides the instruction document, I made an 
example of its implementation.
Main objective: have deep understanding of Software Development Life Cycle, know all of its stages and necessary 
documents, being able to implement it to any project.
